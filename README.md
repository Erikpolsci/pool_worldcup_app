# pool_worldcup_app
 
Application developed during bootcamp consisted of creating a mobile and web application where people could register using their Google accounts, create sweepstakes about Fifa World Cup games among friends and family, for example, and share this among participants in an intuitive and clean interface. You can also share the pool using the unique code of each pool or searching by name. The app turned out excellent and perfectly serves the purpose (which doesn't mean I won't make improvements soon).
